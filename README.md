# PyLox/Olox

I decided to implement the Tree-walk interpreter in Python instead of Odin. The code is in the tree_walk directory. The code is based on the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom. Much of the object oriented design for the tree-walk interpreter was not a great fit for Odin so I decided to use Python instead. That said, I will be porting the second half of the book to Odin for the bytecode interpreter.
